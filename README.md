This project is a small web application that I will build to record and update hospital appointment information using a MySQL database. I will be working on it slowly and adding one small feature at a time so the progress looks steady when I commit to GitHub. The first thing I plan to do is set up a simple webpage that can talk to the database by inserting a piece of information or showing something that is already stored. Once I get that working I will start adding more features bit by bit.

The system will focus on letting someone book an appointment so I will store the appointment date and time in the database. After that I will create another table that holds the patients name and date of birth and then I will link the tables so the information is connected properly. Every time I make changes to the database I will create a new SQL file in the sql folder starting with createDBV1.sql and then adding more versions whenever the database grows. This will help keep a clear record of how the structure changes as the project develops.

I will build the whole project in small steps. Whenever I get a new feature working even if it is something tiny I will commit it straight away so the history shows steady progress instead of sudden jumps. As the project gets bigger I may add simple extra features like more input options or different pages but I will only add them one at a time and only when the earlier parts are already working. By the end the GitHub repository will show a clear path of how the project was built and what it is meant to do which is to let users enter appointment details and view the information from the database whenever needed.
